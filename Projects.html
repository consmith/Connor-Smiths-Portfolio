    <p>This project was originally a team project, that fell through. I decided to
    take the project up on my own. This was my first serious coding project to complete.
    Otherwise I had simply done small excercises and class problems. I completed this project
    during a 1 week period. It was really exciting creating a game, and predicting all
    of the possible legalities that must be considered and whatnot. This project was a very
    exciting first step into more dedicated projects.</p>

    <h5 class = "Project_Titles" id = "Tamu-Event">Tamu Event App - Xcode and Swift</h5>
    <ul>
      <li id = "Broken_Link_one" class = "Project_List"><a href = "#">GitHub</a></li>
      <li id = "Broken_Link_two" class = "Project_List"><a href = "#">Download</a></li>
    </ul>
    <p>I am currently working on this project during my spring semester of 2017.
    I can not say too much about this project, since it has not been released yet.
    Skill-wise though, I can mention what I am using in this project. This project
    is a good test on github, and a fairly in depth use of swift, firebase, and design
    programs such as xcode. This is my first actual project dealing with handling data.</p>

    <h5 class = "Project_Titles" id = "Website">This Website - HTML, CSS, and JavaScript</h5>
    <ul>
      <li class = "Project_List"><a href = "https://github.com/consmith/Connor-Smiths-Portfolio.git">GitHub</a></li>
      <li class = "Project_List"><a href = "#" download>Download</a></li>
    </ul>
    <p>This was technically my first serious project to pick up. I created the original
    site layout within around 2 weeks. Afterwards, I continued randomly adding work to
    the site when I got a chance. This site was fairly easy to create. It was a single person
    project.</p>

      Currently trying to fill this page up more!
