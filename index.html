    <p>
      I have included some basic information about me that I believe is important,
      but might not deserve a separate page. Feel free to access any other page at the top
      left.

      <h5>About Me</h5>
        <p>
          I currently am a 19 year old engineering Sophomore at Texas A&M studying Computer Science.
          During my Junior and Senior year of High school, I went to Richland Collegiate
          High School in Dallas and got my Associates degree in Applied Science at the same time that I
          was getting my High School Diploma. I took this opportunity to lower the workload and amount
					of classes that I was required to take at A&M
				</p> 
				<p>
					As for programming experience,
          I have finished many minor projects to expand my portfolio, and am currently undergoing official Data Structures and Algorithms classes.
          I am very proud of my code, and believe I practice readable code, with good coding standards of comments and design.
          I currently have direct experience in the following languages, although I can pick up others fairly quickly:
				</p>
          <ul>
            <li> - Python</li>
            <li> - Matlab</li>
            <li> - HTML</li>
            <li> - CSS</li>
            <li> - JavaScript</li>
						<li> - R</li>
          </ul>
