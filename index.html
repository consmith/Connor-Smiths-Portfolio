      Welcome! This website is a collection of all personal work and important
      information about myself. Click any link on the navigation bar to follow
      it to the appropriate page. Each page is always being updated with the most
      current information.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have included some basic information about me that I believe is important,
      but might not deserve a separate page. Feel free to access any other page at the top
      right.

    <p>
      Any Questions, Concerns, Feedback, or other reasons for contact can be
      directed to me (Connor Smith) at any of my contact locations. Any more questions

        <p >
          I currently am an 18 year old freshman at Texas A&M, but a Junior by credit hours.
          During my Junior and Senior year of High school, I went to Richland Collegiate
          High School and got my Associates degree in Applied Science at the same time that I
          was getting my High School Diploma. I will be getting my bachelors of Science in Computer Science
          from A&M. <br></br>As for programming experience, I am largely self taught so far, but with good
          software development practice. My code is mantainable and easy to read. I have experience
          with HTML, CSS, and small amounts of JavaScript, C++, and Swift. I am always open to learning
          more about any area of Computer Science, though.
